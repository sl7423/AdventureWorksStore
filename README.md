# AdventureWorksStore

The project is a combination of parts of an ecommerce store with an inbuilt recommendation system, which recommends either similar products or based on past purchases by each user. Django is used to construct the back-end while surprise was used to build the user recommendation system. The dataset comes from the Adventure Works 2019 dataset. Inspiration from this code comes from the surprise library and Rathan Kumar. Deployment of the application is done through Heroku, with database setup in AWS RDS Postgres, and staticfiles are stored via S3.
